# Mergserv!
###### The accompanying server to go with our Android app 'Carpet'.
----

We developed this server to allow the transfer of data between phones using our app.
Each user can take the data recorded with the app and sync with Mergserv to push their data to the server and retrieve everyone else's data.
The language used is Python, since this is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi while at competitions where we have intermittent / no internet.

### Curretly WIP! (Work in progress)
This project was started recently, and the code here won't always be the best. beware: bugs, inefficient code and spaghetti code may be everywhere.
